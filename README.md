AT-CMD (Shell) Description & Revert Instructions

Description:

AT-CMD is a custom terminal/shell that replaces the standard Windows Explorer interface. It allows you to run commands, scripts, and manage your system in a command-line environment. Use it carefully, as it temporarily replaces the normal desktop interface.

How to Revert to Explorer:

If you need to go back to the normal Windows interface:

Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager.
Click File → Run new task.
Type explorer.exe and press Enter.
This will restore the normal Windows desktop and start menu.
