AT-CMD (Shell) Description & Revert Instructions

Description:
AT-CMD is a custom terminal/shell that temporarily replaces the standard Windows Explorer interface. It allows you to run commands, scripts, and manage your system in a command-line environment. Use it carefully, as it overrides the normal desktop interface while running.

How to Revert to Explorer:
If you want to go back to the normal Windows interface:

Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager.

Click File → Run new task.

Type explorer.exe and press Enter.

This will restore the standard Windows desktop and start menu.
